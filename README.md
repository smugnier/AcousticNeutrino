# AcousticNeutrino
This repository has all the code I've been using during my project on acoustic neutrino detection

## Content of the repository:
The repository contains the tests.ipynb which is a jupyter notebook file that I have used to make the different functions useful for the data analysis. There is also a file called functions.py that only contains the functions. One can import the file by typing import functions in your test script. Be careful, the functions.py has to be in the same folder as your test script.
